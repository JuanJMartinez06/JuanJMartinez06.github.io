##My Favorite labs 

#Lab 08, part 1 

- Has to be one of my favorite labs. Dash and I worked on making the judge functions, we had such a good groove going into the assignment and we crushed it. Flying through the work. Using stod and pushback for the first time was a little confusing but all in all it was an enjoyable time.

- Is a very good contender for favorite lab as it was a lab where I felt very confident with my coding. Even with some help with the TA (good guy by the way) Franchesca and I were able to get through the lab. The main reason why it is a contender for favorite lab was that I named the variables myself and to make the lab more fun (even if a little confusing) things such as “slay” “purr” and “stanley” which gave me a reputation of being the “slay guy”.

- While not a contender for favorite lab is definitely one I enjoyed. I worked on it with Eliseo Ochoa. Someone who I remember as Ochoa because of the ex-goalkeeper of the Mexican National Soccer Team. It was a pretty simple lab and it was a joy to work through. Being an earlier lab the types of coding done weren’t very difficult it was still a very good lab.
